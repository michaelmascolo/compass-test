"""
Compass 2.0 — Sprint 1: Assignment Representation.

A self-contained vertical slice. Compass helps the student build an adequate
REPRESENTATION of what an assignment requires before any knowledge gathering or
writing. It leads with assignment demands, uses the student's words diagnostically,
scaffolds ONE high-leverage demand at a time, and never writes the response.

This module owns its own APIRouter + Mongo collection (`assignment_sessions`) and
reuses the shared LLM client + helpers from server.py. It does NOT touch the
existing Milestone writing engine or the Meaning Workspace.
