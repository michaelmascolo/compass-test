"""Milestone 2 tests — enriched 'Opening / Introduction' canonical domain.

These tests specifically exercise:
- Two-stage domain selection picks 'Opening / Introduction' for an
  introduction-focused submission.
- Theory field `alternative_interpretations` is populated (new generic field).
- Multi-turn reliability holds: 3-turn intro session, each turn <60s, no 502.
- No hook / fixed-thesis formula is imposed (invitation does NOT force a
  catchy hook or a specific thesis position).
- AI does not rewrite the student's introduction.
- theory_history grows and changes_since_previous is not 'initial' after
  the first turn.
- Regression: empty content -> 400, missing session -> 404.

Run serially: pytest /app/backend/tests/test_milestone2_opening.py -v -n 0
