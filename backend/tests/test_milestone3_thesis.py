"""Milestone 3 tests — enriched 'Central Claim / Thesis' canonical domain +
generic domain-independent SECTION-LEVEL retrieval.

Scope:
- Data-only sanity: Central Claim / Thesis is enriched to the ~31-field schema
  proven for Opening / Introduction.
- Section-level retrieval: STAGE B reasoner prompt is much smaller than sending
  the whole record because get_relevant_domain_data() filters each record to
  ALWAYS_KEYS + selected sections. Log line format changed in M3:
     '[interact] domains/sections={<name>: <count>, ...} reasoner_prompt_bytes=NNNN'
- Thesis reasoning: submitting an argumentative thesis surfaces 'Central Claim
  / Thesis' among currently_relevant_domains and the invitation is a thinking
  invitation (not an AI-supplied claim).
- Genre sensitivity: a personal / narrative opening does NOT get pushed to
  produce an argumentative thesis.
- Engine contract preserved: one invitation per turn, no rewriting, no fixed
  'X because A, B, C' formula demand.
- Multi-turn 4-turn session (writing -> revise -> answer -> revise) all
  under 60s each, no 502.
- Regression: empty -> 400, missing session -> 404, theory_history preserves
  prior theories, changes_since_previous not 'initial' after turn 1.
